# patreon-to-zune
Proxy that allows importing Patreon podcasts into the Zune desktop software. Probably has at least one other legitimate use. idk.

A live, usable demo can be found [here](https://patreontozune.net/).

`npm install` and `npm start` is all you need. The app runs on port 8080.

A Docker image is available at [corysanin/patreon-to-zune](https://hub.docker.com/r/corysanin/patreon-to-zune).
